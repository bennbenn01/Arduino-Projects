Resistor to power LCD 16 x 2:

- R1 with ohm of 220

Formula that was used to get the temperature:


1. Converting analog reading to voltage:

The analogRead function provides a value between 0 and 1023,
which corresponds to a voltage range of 0 to 5V. The 
formula used here is to convert that reading into a voltage:

voltage = tempValue × 5.0 / 1023.0
​
Where:

- tempValue is the raw analog reading from the temperature 
sensor (range 0-1023).
- voltage is the calculated voltage in the range 0-5V

This formula scales the raw value from the analogRead(which 
is between 0 and 1023) to a voltage (which is between 0 and 
5V).


2. Converting voltage to temperature:

The code uses the TMP36 temperature sensor's characteristics
to convert the measured voltage to a temperature value in 
degrees Celsius. The TMP36 sensor has:

- A 500mV offset at 25°C.
- A 20mV/°C slope (i.e, the voltage increases by 20mV for
for every degree Celsius change in temperature).

The formula for calculating the temperature is devired from 
the TMP36 sensor has:

temperature = (voltage - 0.5) / 0.02

Where:

- voltage is the voltage measured from the temperature sensor.
- 0.5 represents the 500mV offset (this corresponds to 25°C).
- 0.02 is the slope of the sensor (20mV per°C, or 0.02V per °C).

This formula rearranges the TMP36 sensor's output equation

Vout = 500mV + (20mV x (Temperature - 25°C))

To calculate the temperature:

Temperature =  (Vout - 500mV) / 20mV

In the code, 500mV is represented as 0.5V, and 20mV/°C is 
represented as 0.02 V/°C.


3. LCD Contrast Control (Optional Formuala)

The code includes a direct auto contrast adjustment for the LCD 
screen. The contrast of the LCD is set using the analogWrite 
function, which sends a value between 0 and 255 to control
the contrast:

analogWrite(contrastPin, 30)

Where:
- contrastPin is the pin connected to the LCD's contrast control
- 30 is the value for the contrast, where 0 is the lightest and 
255 is the darkest
