Resistor to power the LCD 16 x 2:

- R1 with ohm of 220

Formula that was used to get the Distance:

Distance (cm) = Duration (µs) x 0.034 / 2

Where:

- duration: This is the time it takes for the ultrasonic pulse 
to travel to the object and back to the sensor, measured in 
microseconds (µs). This is captured using the pulseIn(echoPin, 
HIGH) function, which measures the time the echoPin remains HIGH 
(indicating the pulse is being received).
- 0.034: This value represents the speed of sound in air in 
centimeters per microseconds (cm/µs). The speed of sound is 
approxiamately 343 meters per second, or 34,300 cm/s, which is 
equivalent to 0.034 cm/µs. The formula assumes that sound travel
at this speed.
- 2: The factor of 2 accounts for the fact that the time measured
is for the round trip of the sound wave (to the object and back).
To calculate the one-way distance, we divide by 2.
